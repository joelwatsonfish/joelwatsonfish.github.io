<p>The main purpose of this blog is to be a place for me to fail.
Publicly.  Perhaps spectacularly.  So it goes &ndash; that&rsquo;s just how I
learn.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Let me elaborate.</p>

<p><br>
There are some subjects I know fairly well, but I don&rsquo;t really want to
discuss them here. On the other hand, there are a lot of other
things that I don&rsquo;t know well, but that I&rsquo;d like to understand much
better.  Psychology, evolution, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary game
theory, decision theory, economics, genetics (behavioral, population, and
quantitative), probability, statistics&hellip; the list goes on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to use this space to talk about ideas I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about and that I&rsquo;d like to develop further.  But by design, these are
topics I don&rsquo;t know much about, so I&rsquo;m simply going to be wrong a lot.  So
what?  For me, the learning process is all about failing.  There is
nothing I&rsquo;ve become skilled at that I haven&rsquo;t failed at.  Often.  This is
not a set back, it&rsquo;s just part of the process.  Learn by failing;
stumbling toward enlightenment.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>So let me set some standard forewarning, which will apply to everything
that appears on these pages.</p>

<h3 id="standing-caveat">Standing Caveat:</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing, and whatever I say is probably riddled with
errors. Nothing written here necessarily reflects the beliefs, intentions,
or understanding of anyone other than me, and my views are likely to
change as I learn. I&rsquo;m doing my best with the limited time,
energy, and brainpower I have to spare.  I realize it&rsquo;s insufficient.
That&rsquo;s life.</p>
